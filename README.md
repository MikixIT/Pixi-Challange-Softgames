# Softgames Game Developer Assignment

## Overview

This project contains the solution to the Softgames Game Developer challenge consisting of three tasks:

1. **Ace of Shadows**  
   Implemented 144 sprites stacked like a deck of cards. The top card moves every 1 second to another stack with a smooth 2-second animation.

2. **Magic Words**  
   Created a chat dialogue system that combines text and custom emojis, fetching dialogue data from the provided API endpoint.

3. **Phoenix Flame**  
   Developed a particle-effect demo simulating a fire effect using up to 10 sprites simultaneously.

## Technical Details

- Written entirely in **TypeScript**.
- Uses **Pixi.js v7** for rendering all scenes.
- Animations handled with **GSAP** for smooth transitions.
- Responsive rendering for both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- Displays an FPS counter in the top-left corner.
- Runs full screen for immersive experience.
- All three tasks are accessible from a main in-game menu.

## Challenges & Notes

- I have **limited prior experience with Pixi.js**, and encountered some difficulties adapting to version 7.0, as many examples and tutorials are based on version 8.0.
- The challenge was assigned around 2 PM with a strict **24-hour deadline**, so I had roughly half a day to work intensively on it.
- To meet the deadline, I automated some repetitive tasks using AI assistance and focused on delivering a functional, clean solution.
- While I am not fully satisfied with every detail, Iâ€™m proud to submit this work and grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through your challenge.
- My main background is as a **Fullstack Developer for web applications**, and this experience has been very rewarding and motivating.

## How to run

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Access the app via the local server URL.
- Navigate the in-game menu to test each task.

## Final thanks

Thank you for this exciting challenge. It pushed me to expand my skills, especially in game development with Pixi.js and animation with GSAP. I look forward to your feedback and the possibility to improve further.
